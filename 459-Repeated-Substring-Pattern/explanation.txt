If the entire string is constructed of a repeated substring, then that substring/pattern must occur 
at the beginning of the string. Therefore the problem can be solved by building a KMP algorithm 
fail table.

eg. abacabac

The fail table will be [0,0,1,0,1,2,3,4]. The last element of the table tells us the current matching
length relative to the start of the string (variable length_repeated). This number should be divisible 
by the length of the pattern, which can be found by subtracting the total length of the string by 
length_repeated. 

So for abacabac: 
- length_repeated = 4
- length_substring = 8 - 4 = 4

If instead the string was abacaba: 
- fail table = [0,0,1,0,1,2,3] 
- length_repeated = 3
- length_substring = 8 - 3 = 5, which is not a divisor of 8.
